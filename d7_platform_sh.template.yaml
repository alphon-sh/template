## Project behavior schema

# Allows products and project creation to define
# various settings and workflow modifications

# The schema is versioned so that we can establish code paths differently in the future if we need to change this.
version: 1

# Templates are a small amount of information supporting a template URL. Each template is selectable at the project-creation step.
info:
  # Unique machine name, prefaced by a vendor or organization identifier
  id: platformsh/drupal7
  # The human-readable name of the template.
  name: Drupal 7
  # Human-readable descriptive text for the template. Supports limited HTML.
  description: The Symfony Standard Edition distribution.
  # A list of tags associated with the template.
  tags:
  - PHP
  - Drupal
  - CMS
  # An image URI (either base64-encoded or a URL) representing the template.
  image: <some image uri>
  # Additional notes displayed in the template's detail view.
  # Each note object is displayed as a small section heading with content below. Supports limited HTML.
  notes:
    - heading: "Apps & Services"
      content: "PHP 7.2<br/>Redis 4.0.6"
    - heading: "Requirements"


# This key describes the initialization call made to the master environment at
# project creation time. This is part of the full v2 UI operation mode, which
# places project schema/options selection early in the creation process, rather
# than later as it exitss now. To allow this schema to be backwards-compatible,
# this key also gets mapped to the appropriate location in project.settings so
# that the current UI can have its own workflow overridden as well.

# This key allows users to set the default values for various project API calls,
# including project settings, variables, and access control. These are populated
# by the Accounts provisioning process immediately after project creation.
defaults:
  # This key is used to set admin-level settings from
  # Accounts at project creation.
  settings:
    use_drupal_defaults: FALSE
    enable_certificate_provisioning: FALSE
  # This key creates variables at the project level.

## We intend to allow this schema to enforce the same keys at synchronization
## time, but this is NYI.
## enforced:
##   settings:
##   variables:
##   access:
# An object allowing us to determine which regions are accessible.

regions:
  # Removes regions from the list and blocks them from being used for
  # this project.
  exclude:
    - us-2.platform.sh
    - au.platform.sh
    - eu-2.platform.sh
    - nl-1.platform.sh
  # This adds regions not in the default list, making them
  # accessible to the user for this project/checkout.
  additional:
    - bc.platform.sh
  # This key overrides the list provided by the defaults + the additional key,
  # but does not permit access to any excluded regions. For this key, the last
  # implementation of this key will "win" (i.e. the project level will supersede
  # the vendor level if this key is present.)
  only:
    - us.platform.sh
    - eu.platform.sh

## Sets the available plans in the same way:
plans:
  # Removes plans from the list and bloceks them from being used for this
  # project.
  exclude:
    - development
    - small
  # This adds regions not in the default list, making them
  # accessible to the user for this project/checkout.
  additional:
    - 2xlarge
    - xlarge
  # This key overrides the list provided by the defaults + the additional key,
  # but does not permit access to any excluded plans. For this key, the last
  # implementation of this key will "win" (i.e. the project level will supersede
  # the vendor level if this key is present.)
  only:
    - magento/2xlarge
    - magento/xlarge
